                        In previous blog posts we have shown how to generate timelapses and we have shown how to get full resolution images.  This post will show how to combine those two features together to generate a high resolution timelapse.

                   <p>
                       We're going to use the example code from our blog post on <a href="article-12.html">Getting High Resolution Images from Video</a> to get the full resolution images.  We will then modify our example in the <a href="article-8.html">previous blog post</a> to get those images instead of the low resolution thumbnails.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Because we are pulling little video clips as the source for each image, the total time it takes will go up.  This is depending on the amount of activity in the camera and the upload bandwidth at site.  Both of those factors add to the variability of how long the process will take.  We are going to run this from a script but in production I would recommend pre-computing this information before the user requests it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is example is in the file <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-timelapse/blob/master/timelapse-part-3.py">timelapse-part-3.py</a>.  This is mostly the same as the previous example except on line 84 we are calling <a href="https://een.cloud/framepuller">https://een.cloud/framepuller/</a> instead of getting a preview image throught the Eagle Eye API.

                        I hope this series of blog posts on generating timelapses has been helpful.  I will have another project coming on making a webapp that automatically generates these timelapses as part of a user's dashboard.  It uses the same ideas that we have already discussed.  Its purpose is show how a full example could come together. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope you found this helpful.  If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to us at api_support@een.com
