                        There are several common questions that we get as people start using the <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/"> Eagle Eye Networks API</a>.  This won't cover all of them, but we hope that it will answer some of them.

                       The <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-list-of-cameras">list of devices</a> returned depends on the permissions that the user has.  It will only return items that they have access to.  This can include devices in the same account or devices shared with them from another account.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        If you user is created on a reseller account you will not have access to any devices until you switch into a sub-account.  The reseller account itself does not contain any devices.  All devices live in sub-accounts.  You can get a <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-list-of-accounts">list of sub-accounts</a> and <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#switch-account">switch context</a> into any account you have access to.  After changing your context, you will have access to the devices in that account with administrator permissions.

                   <p>
		   The reason we have users in both places is so you can add users to just a specific sub-account or have users that work for the reseller that can manage multiple sub-accounts.
		   </p>
		   <p> Imaging having two different installations, not having a reseller account make it difficult to manage all equipment and users in a single account. It would also be challenging to make sure every user had the correct permissions to just their equipment.
		</p>
		<p> By separating out the reseller and the sub-accounts, we can provide isolation so that cameras are not inadvertently shared. We can also provide a much simpler user management interface.

                        You can access a video stream by calling <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-video"> get video</a>.  By default we return the original h.264 video wrapped in a FLV container.  This always us to pass the video without transcoding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Access live and recorded video is done through the same API call.  The primary difference is that recorded video uses a start and end timestamp.  Live video uses a stream identifier instead of a start timestamp.  Live video also uses a video offset instead of an end timestamp.  You can continue viewing the live stream by calling the API again using the same parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recorded video can also be returned as an MP4 file.  In this case, we will transcode the file.  When requesting an MP4 file you will receive a job id, or the file directly.  If you receive a job id, you can make the same call again until the file is done transcoding and is available to download.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can play live and recorded video in any player that can handle FLV and MP4 files.  You can also follow the instrustions <a href="article-20.html"> here </a> to use our HTML5 video player.  This is a JavaScript file that allows the built-in HTML5 video tag to play FLV files.

                       CORS is a security policy implement in modern web browsers.  It is a great safey meansure, but it can cause difficulty when trying to use our API from a client's browser.  If you are hitting errors with CORS, please reach out to us so that we can get your domain approved for CORS access.
