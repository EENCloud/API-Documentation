        <title>Learning a New Skill: CNC</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been a huge fan of 3D printing and additive manufacturing.  It is great for functional items like brackets, mounts, and replacement parts to fix a vacuum.  The only problem, is that most people don't actual want stuff made out of plastic.</p>

<p>Switching over to subtractive manufacturing, and step back 50 years in time, brings us to CNC.  CNC is an elegant technology in the sense that it is fairly simple, robust, proven to work, and incredibly flexible.  The biggest problems with it are having to learn all the related woodworking sills and that most people don't want coasters any more than they want plastic widgets.<p>

<p>So why spend the time and money to learn it?<p>

<p>First, it is a robot cutting things that I design in a digital space.  All of the annoyances of measuring, sawing, measuring again, goes away when it can be designed digitally first.</p>

<p>Second, it is a stepping stone to doing parts fabrication.  Graduating up to machining metal is the real goal.  The skills I'm learning now will directly translate up the to larger machines.  Doing carbon fiber composite work needs molds and some molds are easier to CNC than to 3D print.</p>

<p>Third, working with wood is surprisingly satisfying.  There is a whole community of people who woodwork and even casual acquaintances would rather talk about a nice slab of maple instead of hearing about the new LWPLA filament. </p>

<p>Looking at the image at the top of this post, the object itself is more interesting than the same shapes 3D printed.   It just seems like more effort and skill were required.  It did require more effort and skill and that is the whole point.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Where I Use Docker Containers</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
Skipping the hype around Docker, Kubernetes, and containers in general; I wanted to talk through how I use them and where they have been very helpful.  The three use cases I want to highlight are local development, API examples, and deployment.
</p>

<p>
Local development with Python is a headache of dependencies and conflicting Python versions.  You can use virtual environments or Docker containers, but docker containers have several other advantages when deploying or sharing.  If you start from a fresh python image you will have to explicitly declare your module dependencies which becomes great documentation.
</p>

<p>
Providing API examples inside of a Docker container is another great use.  When bringing people up to speed with a new API it is vital to get them early success and it is important to quickly get past the drudgery of getting an example to run.  If you keep the docker container as a very light wrapper, there is very little confusion versus delivering them just the source directly.
</p>

<p>
Example API scripts for the Eagle Eye Networks Cloud VMS are available <a href="
https://github.com/mcotton/EE-API-examples">here on github</a>.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to use Docker-compose for deployments in production.  If there is a chance that I will deploy it at some point, than I start with docker-compose even when just running it locally.  I find that the full DevOps-level tools are too much overhead for not enough gain.  I feel the same about container registries.  I haven't found the advantage to publishing the complete example back to a registry.
</p>

<p>
I run nginx locally on each instance for SSL termination and then use "proxy_pass" to send the traffic to the correct Docker container.  This works great locally also because you can access those same entry points on localhost.  The basic structure is shown below:
</p>

<pre>

server {

    root /var/www/html;

    client_max_body_size 100M;

    server_name xxxx.een.cloud;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }

}
</pre>

<p>
Running it locally you can have all requests go to the single container running on port 3000 as shown above.  When you are in production, you can split up your traffic by URL requests to go to additional copies of the same container.  In this case, I want to work on my main webapp, ingestion API, and notification system to work independently.  I can do this by modifying my nginx config and docker-compose.yaml as shown below.
</p>

<pre>

server {

    root /var/www/html;

    client_max_body_size 100M;

    server_name xxxx.een.cloud;

    location /api/ingest {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    }

    location /api/notification {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3002;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }

}
</pre>


<pre>
version: '3'
  
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
    restart: always
    tty: true

  ingestor:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    restart: always
    tty: true

  notification:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
    restart: always
    tty: true

</pre>



<p>
This isn't the complete answer for how everyone should use Docker everywhere, it is just want I've found helpful.  Hopefully it is helpful to others.

        <title>Making Python use all those Cores and  RAM</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
It is cheap and easy to build a machine with 8/16 cores and 32GB of RAM.  It is more complicated to make Python use all those resources.  This blog post will go through strategies to use all the CPU, RAM, and the speed of your storage device.
<p>

<p>
I am using the AMD 3700x from my <a href="https://mcottondesign.com/post/ahRzfm1jb3R0b25kZXNpZ24zLWhyZHIRCxIEQmxvZxiAgID06p-PCQw">previous post</a>.  It has 8 cores and 16 threads.  For this post I will be treating it each thread as a core because that is how Ubuntu displays it in System Monitor.
</p>

<p>
Looping through a of  directory of 4 million images and doing inference on them one by one is slow.  Most of time is waiting on system IO.  Loading the image from disk into RAM is slow.  Transforming the image once it is in RAM is very fast and making an inference with the GPU is also fast.  In that case Python will only be using 1/16th of the available total processing power and only that single images will be stored in RAM.  Using a SSD or NVME device instead of a traditional hard drive does speed it up, but not enough.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/cpu_2.png" style="width:80%">
<br>
Loading images into RAM is great but you will run out at some point so it is best to lazy load them.  In this case I wrote a quick generator function that takes an argument of the batch size it should load.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/cpu_3.png" style="width:80%">
<br>
Dealing with a batch of images is better than loading them individually but they still need to be pre-processed by the CPU and placed in a queue.  This is slow when the CPU is only apple to use 1/16th of its abilities.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/cpu_1.png" style="width:80%">
<br>
Using the included <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a> package you can easily create a bunch of processes and use a queue to shuffle data between them.  It also includes the ability to create a pool of processes to make it even more straight forward.
</p>

<p>
In my own testing, my HDD was still slowing down the system because it wasn't able to keep all of the CPU processes busy. I was only able to utilize ~75% of my CPU when loading from a 7200RPM HDD.  For testing purposes I loaded up a batch on my NVME drive and it easily exceed the CPUs ability to process them.  Only having a single NVME drive I will need to wait for prices to come down before I can convert all of my storage over to ultra-fast flash.
</p>

<p>
Using the above code you can easily max out your RAM and CPU.  Doing this for batches of images means that there is always a supply of images in RAM for the GPU to consume.  It also means that going through those 4 million images won't take longer than needed.  Next challenge is to speed up GPU inference.

        <title>Curating Datasets is the New Programming</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
Machine learning has changed how I approach new programming tasks. I am going to be working through an example of detecting vehicles in a specific parking space.  Traditionally this would be done by looking for motion inside of a specific ROI (region of interest).  In this blog post I will be talking through achieving better results by focusing on dataset curation and machine learning.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_01.jpg" style="width:40%">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_02.jpg" style="width:40%">
</p>

<p>
The traditional way to detect a vehicle would be to try and catch it at a transition point, entering or exiting the frame.  You could compare the video frames to see what has changed and if an object has entered or exiting the ROI.  You could set up an expect minimum and maximum object size to improve accuracy and avoid false positive results..
</p>

<p>
Another way would be to look for known landmarks at known locations such as lines separating spaces or disabled vehicle symbol.  This would involve some adjustment for scaling and skew but it could have a startup routine that was able to adapt to reasonable values for both.  It wouldn't be detecting a vehicle, but there is a high probability that if the features are not visible then the spot is occupied.  This should work at night by choosing features that have some degree of visibility at night or through rain.
</p>

<p>
A third technique could be similar to the previous example expect looking at the dominant color instead of specific features.  This would not work at night when the camera switches to IR illumination and an IR filter.  This sounds like a lazy option, but in specific circumstances it could perform quite well for looking for brown UPS vehicles that only make deliveries during daylight hours
</p>

<p>
In the traditional methods, you would look at the image with OpenCV and then operate on pixel data.  Some assumptions would need to made on how individual pixels should be group together to form an object.  The ROI would need to be defined.   Care would also need to applied when handing how individual pixels create a specific feature, or are composed a color between our threshold values.  All of this has been done before. 
</p>

.<p>
The approach I am advocating for is to not program anything about the image at all.  Each frame would be looked at and the model would make a prediction regardless of motion, features, or dominant colors.  Such a general approach could easily be marketed as AI.  I prefer to call it machine learning to clarify that the machine is doing the work and that it's only intelligence is in its ability to compare to known images.  Think of it as a graph with a line that separates it into categories.  The algorithm's only job is to predict where to place each image on the correct side of the line.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_03.png" style="width:80%">
</p>

<br>

<p>
As more example images are added to the model, the line separating the groups of images changes to accomodate the complete dataset.  If you are not careful to keep the two groups balanced than biases in the datasets can appear.  Think of this as a simple programming bug.
</p>


<p>

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_05.jpg" style="width:40%">
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_06.png" style="width:80%">
</p>

<br>

<p>
The first image is considered in the parking space, the second image is not.  In both cases, the vehicle is blocking the parking space.  The difference is arbitrary, but these special cases can be handled by including examples in the correct dataset.  Think of what goes into the datasets as domain specific rules.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_07.jpg" style="width:40%">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_08.jpg" style="width:40%">
</p>


<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_09.png" style="width:80%">
</p>

<br>

<p>It is easy to build a dataset based on images evenly spaced through the day.  Doing this should give good coverage of all lighting conditions.  This method also trains the model with a potential hidden bias.  Because there are more cars parking during the day, it is more likely the model will learn that night time always means there is no car.  The image on left shows a person walking and gets a different result than a nearly identical image during the day.  The image on the right is included to balance the dataset to account for this bias.

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_10.jpg" style="width:40%">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_11.jpg" style="width:40%">
</p>

<p>
The line separating the two groups is getting more complicated and would be very difficult to program using traditional methods.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/handicap_blog_post_12.png" style="width:80%">
</p>

<br>

<p>
These final examples show that the model must be able to account for unexpected events such as heavy rain or a car parked sideways.  Handling unexpected data like this using the traditional methods would require significant rework.
</p>

<p>

<br>

<p>
In building this model, the programming stayed the same.  It is all about the data and the curation of the datasets.  The future of programming will be based on curating datasets and less about hand coding rules.  I'm very excited for this change in programming and the new applications that can be made through it.  We will need our tooling to catch up and I am excited to be working on it.

        <title>Building an AI/ML workstation in 2020</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
The cloud is a great way to get started with AI/ML.  The going rate is around $4/hr for a GPU instance.  It might be all that you need, but if you need to maximize your personal hardware buget this is my guide to buiding workstation.
</p>

<h3>Price</h3>
<p>
I spent ~$1000 and you could get it even lower with the current deals.  I decided on a AMD Ryzen 3700X, Nvidia 2060 Super, 32GB of RAM, and an NVME drive.  I could connect all of this into a B450m motherboard so I didn't see any reason to spend more.  I also include another SSD for Windows 10 and two HDDs for storing datasets.
</p>

<h3>CPU</h3>
<p>
The Ryzen 3700x is far more than I need and most of the time several cores are idle.  Because most of my tooling is in python it is a real struggle to make use of the resources.  The multiprocess library is great and it isn't too complicated to make a Pool of CPU cores for the program to use.
</p>


<h3>GPU</h3>
<p>
The 2060 Super is in a very odd position in the current lineup.  It is the cheapest model with 8GB of VRAM, to get 3GB more you have to 3x the price.  It makes more sense to jump up to 24GB for 6x the price.  Training CNN models on image data requires significant amounts of VRAM.  You could spend more but without more VRAM the money would only provide marginal improvements due to the number of CUDA cores.
</p>

<h3>RAM</h3>
<p>
System memory is very similar to CPU cores, you will rarely max it out but it never hurts to have more avialable.  I typically am using 20GB which means that I could reduce my batch size and done with 16GB or I could just been the extra $80.
</p>

<h3>STORAGE</h3>
<p>
I'm using a 1TB NVME drive.  It is very fast and tucks away nicely on the motherboard.  It is overkill for my needs but it is nice to have the space to store millions of images and not wait on traditional HDDs.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of HDDs.  I have two, a 1TB and a 2TB.  The 1TB is just for datasets and so that I can keep space available on the faster drive.  The second drive is for automatic backsups of the main disk and datasets.  Backups are also doing to two different NASs but that is another blog post.
</p>

<p>
It would be a shame to have this machine and not play games on it.  I'm using an inexpensive 1TB SSD for Windows 10.  I don't like dual booting off of a single drive.  I prefer using the bios boot selector to switch between OSes.
</p>

<h3>COOLING</h3>
<p>
The case I'm using has four 120mm fans.  I added a giant Nactua heat sink with two additional 140mm fans.  Adjust the motherboard fan curves so that everything is nice and quiet.  I believe in having a lot of airflow and I haven't had any temperature problems (inside the case, the damn thing very noticably heats up my office).
</p>

<h3>UPGRADES</h3>
<p>
I'm currently happy with the way it is.  The obvious upgrade will be for more GPU VRAM.  I decided against water-cooling but if I get to a place with multiple GPUs that appears to be the best solution.

        <title>Blinking a light when Eagle Eye camera detects motion</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<iframe style="width:100%; height:500px; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQq4EPSQkS0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
This is a quick video on how to blink a light when an Eagle Eye camera detects motion.  There are plenty of ways to do this, and this is just the way I decided based on what I had available on my desk.
</p>


<p>
I used the following parts:
<ul>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 2B</li>
    <li>Arduino Uno</li>
    <li>one red LED</li>
    <li>3D printed Eagle Eye logo</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-blinker">EE-blinker</a> that runs on the Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-blinker/tree/master/blink_sketch">blink_sketch</a> that runs on the Arduino</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Arduino was configured with the red LED on pin 13.  The sketch looks for serial communication (over the USB port from the Raspberry Pi) of an ASCII character.  If the character is '1' then it turns on, if it is '2' then it turns off.
</p>

<p>
As an aside, why didn't I make it 1 or 0?  Because originally I was planning on having multiple states and the states did a sequence of things.
</p>


<p>
The Raspberry Pi is just running a Node.js program and it could be replace by any other computer.  The program itself could also be replaced with any other language to subscribe to the Eagle Eye API.
</p>

<p>
You can see the code for the entire project <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-blinker">here</a>.  Make sure to read the README file and follow the instructions to create an appropriate `config.js` file.  It also contains the correct serial port for connecting to the Arduino so make sure you have that correct.
</p>

<p>
The above example is listening for motion events.  Specifically it is listening for <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#event-objects">ROMS and ROME events</a> (ROI motion start, ROI motion end).  It could easily be adapted to use other events.
</p>

<p>
If you are monitoring for status changes (camera online/offline, recording on/off, streaming on/off) you most likely want to listen the <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#status-bitmask"> status bitmask</a> directly.  The events are delayed because we go through our own internal heuristics to filter out false positives.
</p>

<p>
You can find an example of subscribing to the poll stream, getting the status bitmask, and parsing it in this <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-API-examples/blob/master/Listen_for_status_changes.py">example project</a>.

        <title>Detecting an open garage door with Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Eagle Eye</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="toc_1">Introduction</h2>

<p>I wanted to know if the garage door is left open.  This is how I trained my computer to text me when it has been open for too long.</p>

<p>Detecting if a garage door is open or closed is a surprisingly challenging problem.  It is possible to do this with contact sensors or even with a motion (PIR) sensor, but that requires running additional wires and a controller.</p>

<p>My solution was to put a wireless IP camera to the ceiling.  It connects to my home network using wifi and plugs into the same power outlet as the garage door opener.</p>

<p>Traditional video security analytics such as motion or line cross does not adequately detect the door being left open.  Both motion and line cross depend on something happening to trigger.  This is different because I am looking the position of the garage door instead of movement.</p>

<p>I also looked at a traditional computer vision solution to detect sunlight coming in through the open door.  Ultimately trying to detect based on the &#39;brightness&#39; of the scene would not work in this situation.  The way the camera is position it would not be able to differential between the light from the ceiling and sunlight coming in through the garage door.  This also would not work at night or during a storm.  A different tool is needed.</p>

<p>I wanted to experiment with creating a machine learning model.  This is a great first project to get start with.</p>

<p>The first large barrier to creating a machine learning model is the need for enough training data.  It is common to hear about the burden of gathering and dealing with training data.  I though I would need tens of thousands of images and it would be hours of classifying the images by hand.  In the end I was able to train the model with a total of 400 images and I didn&#39;t even have to look at all of them.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Gathering the Images</h2>

<p>The camera I am using records video.  It is easy to think of video as a collection of individual frames.  Each frame can be exported as an image.  This means the camera is potentially producing 30 images per second at a 1920x1080 resolution.  Having days of recorded video, I can use this to make gather images easy.</p>

<p>My security camera is connected through <a href="https://een.com">Eagle Eye Networks</a>.  Eagle Eye is a cloud based video security company with an open API.  It makes it easy to retrieve images and videos.  In addition to the HD video, the API  automatically generate a lower resolution JPEG ever second.  That is more than enough for this project.</p>

<p>Using their history browser I looked for spans of time when the door was closed and download that group of images.  I also picked out ranges when the door was open.  At one frame per second, I only needed a little over a three minute span to get the 200 hundred images I needed.  <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-training/blob/master/preview_downloader.py">Source code on Github</a></p>

<p>I got a list of the preview images using <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-list-of-images">this API endpoint</a> and then downloaded them with <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-image">this API endpoint</a>.  I created zip folder of each batch of images to make the next step easier.</p>

<p>You can highlight a section of time in the history browser by dropping two markers.  Click anywhere on the timeline to drop a marker and then hold &quot;shift&quot; and click somewhere else.  A highlighted section will show up as illustrated in the image below.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/historybrowser.png" style="width:60%"></center></p>

<p>You can easily get the timestamps of the markers you selected by clicking on the clipboard icon in the lower left corner.  It will copy a URL that contains the timestamps.  It is formatted like this <code>https://c012.eagleeyenetworks.com/#/camera_history/10090759/20190724173015.762/20190724173015.762/20190724173453.262</code> with <code>20190724173015.762</code> as the timestamp of the first marker and <code>20190724173453.262</code> as the timestamp of the second.   The camera ID is <code>10090759</code> in the URL above.</p>

<p>With the camera ID, start and end timestamps you can get a list of preview images.I got a list of the preview images using <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-list-of-images">this API endpoint</a> and then downloaded them with <a href="https://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com/apidocs/#get-image">this API endpoint</a>.  You can also use the included script named <code>preview_downloader.py</code> to automate the process.  I created zip folder of each batch of images to make the next step easier.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Creating the Model</h2>

<p>For my first model, I decided to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl/">Google&#39;s AutoML</a> tool to create the model.  AutoML generates a TensorFlow that can be run in their cloud or downloaded and run locally.  The easiest way to run it is inside of a docker container using their Docker image.</p>

<p>Every time the model is given an image it makes a prediction.  The prediction is a confidence value for each label it was trained with.  I want to get an answer from the model saying the door is open or closed.  Because is a binary decision, I can just compare the two values and choose the one with the higher confidence value.</p>

<p>This problem is a great fit for image classification.  We are able to provide sample images of both open and closed.  When asking it to make predictions it is doing less guessing and more matching to what we trained it with.</p>

<p>For all the details you should read through Google&#39;s excellent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl/">tutorials</a>.  Creating this model was as easy as starting a new model, uploading the two zip files and letting it run.  AutoML is smart enough to label all the images in a zip file the the name of the file itself.  When the model is done generating, you can testing it in the AutoML tool.  I recommend experimenting with additional training data if it doesn&#39;t get the predictions correct.</p>

<p>After you&#39;re confident in the accuracy of the model, you can use their hosted version or choose to generate an &quot;Edge&quot; model.  I already am running servers so it was easier to download and run myself.  Follow the instructions to download and run the model inside a Docker container.  The tf_lite version of the model can run on mobile devices or even a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h4 id="toc_4">Note:</h4>

<p>If we wanted to pick out objects out of the image (people or cars or bicycles) we would want to change our strategy and use object detection instead of image classification.  The amount of prep work and training data would increase because we would need to provide examples of each object in a variety of conditions.  This is something I will experiment with in the future.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Connecting the Plumbing</h2>

<p>The next step is to get images from the camrea in real-time.  Eagle Eye has an events API that you can subscribe to and be notified everytime a new preview image is generated.  Passing the model a preview image we can query our new model to get back the label predictions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve put the code <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/EE-training/blob/master/listen_for_previews.py">on Github</a>, but here are the highlights:</p>

<p>Subscribe to the Events API</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none"> ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(&#39;wss://login.eagleeyenetworks.com/api/v2/Device/{}/Events&#39;.format(account_id),
 cookie=&#39;auth_key={}&#39;.format(auth_key),
 on_message=on_message,
 on_error=on_error,
 on_close=on_close)</code></pre></div>

<p>For each event, get the preview image</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">url = &quot;https://login.eagleeyenetworks.com/asset/asset/image.jpeg&quot;

querystring = {&quot;id&quot;: device_id, &quot;timestamp&quot;: ts, &quot;asset_class&quot;: &quot;all&quot; }
payload = &quot;&quot;
headers = { &#39;authorization&#39;: api_key }

response = session.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, data=payload, params=querystring, headers=headers, timeout=5)</code></pre></div>

<p>After you have the image, pass it to <code>container_predict</code></p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">image_data = response.content

output = container_predict(image_data, ts)</code></pre></div>

<p>Check if it the garage door is open and send a SMS if it is</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">closed = output[&#39;predictions&#39;][0][&#39;scores&#39;][0]
opened = output[&#39;predictions&#39;][0][&#39;scores&#39;][1]

if opened &gt;= closed:
    message = &quot;garage door is open [%s, %s]&quot; % (opened, closed)
    send_sms(message)</code></pre></div>

<p>and the SMS part</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">sms = twilio_client.messages.create(to=&quot;+15551234567&quot;, from_=&quot;+5551234567&quot;, body=message)</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="toc_6">Putting it all Together</h2>

<p>I created a <code>docker-compse.yaml</code> file to launch the Tensorflow model and my python script.</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">version: &#39;3&#39;

services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    restart: always
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true

  tensorflow:
    image: gcr.io/automl-vision-ondevice/gcloud-container-1.12.0:latest
    volumes: 
      - ./model/ICN7344367954367448370/2019-07-10_19-43-49-142_tf-saved-model/:/tmp/mounted_model/0001
    ports:
      - &quot;8501:8501&quot;
    restart: always</code></pre></div>

<p>and the individual <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">FROM python:3.7.2-slim

COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install --upgrade pip

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . /app

CMD [ &quot;./startup.sh&quot; ]</code></pre></div>

<p>You can run the whole thing by bringing up the Docker containers</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none"> docker-compose up --build -d</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="toc_7">How Well Does it Work</h2>

<p>It is really good.  Really, really good.</p>

<p>Here are two examples, the first is a normal use case and the second is intended to trick it.  In both cases it gets the predictions correct.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/test_set_1.gif" alt="">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/test_set_1-results.png" style="width:40%">
</p>

<p>For the second example it was able to correctly predict that the door stayed closed.  I never trained it with people in the image and the door closed.</p>

<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-mcottondesign/test_set_2.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>My theory of why it works so well, is that because it is such a simple image classification model.  We could probably do the same thing by comparing each incoming image against the 400 images we used in a training set.  Maybe apply a little gaussian blur to the images to soften the sharp edges.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>I am really pleased with how this project turned out.  Creating the model and get predictions was easier than expect.  It was painless to connect it to the Eagle Eye API to get the images and then send SMS messages out through the <a href="https://twilio.com">Twilio</a> API.</p>

<p>Now that I have it working, I am starting to look for more problems that can be solved using this same pattern.  </p>

<p>Thanks for reading my experience and feel free to reach out to me with questions.</p>

This is a kit that I designed and printed.  Each bomb bay requires a channel on your RC receiver.  In this video I am using an 8-channel receiver but you easily disconnect your rudder and use that while you fly the plane with just bank and yank.

        <title>Why are coders afraid of writing code?</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>At a previous startup, I had a great idea that we could improve our product with realtime updates from the server.  At the time we had implemented long-polling in the client. After failing to get everyone on board I decided to take a weekend to create an example with socket.io and Node.js.</p>

<p>On Monday morning I was proud to show it off around the company.  The CEO liked the idea and agreed with me. Yay! We got on a call with the CTO and I proudly explained my work. </p>

<p>He looked at it, then asked me to go into further detail about my choices. How did I implement this?  Tell him about websockets?  How can we roll it into productions?  What does it look like at the HTTP layer?  Well, I could sort of answer his questions.  I had to confess that I really didn't  know and I used socket.io and it uses websockets. </p>

<p>He probed a little more and then started to get impatient. I couldn't believe that he had become dismissive. And worse, the CEO followed his lead. I hadn't figured it out yet but I had made a critical mistake.</p>

<p>Would we now be implementing the socket.io abstraction?  Is this what we want?  What trade off does that mean for us?  Is this the only way?</p>

<p>I was afraid to learn how the technology actually worked and I was asking the company to take in several major dependencies in order to implement this. </p>

<p>I stubbornly maintained my position. Why would we skip over an existing answer?  I had proved it was working. They could see it working. <i>Why were they not as excited as I am?</i></p>

<p>We were at an impasse and I still hadn't figured it out yet. </p>

<p>Fast-forward to now, and I am a first time CTO.  I've spent a lot of time thinking about lessons learned from my friend, the CTO in the previous story.   I do my best to consider why he made the choices he did. </p>

<p>I'm interviewing candidates and I'm starting to see a similar pattern with other developers. They gladly accept dependencies and baggage that limits options and forces a direction.   They'll make a terrible choice to avoid doing something that makes then uncomfortable. </p>

<p><i>Coders are afraid of writing code. </i></p>

<p>A fiend of mine recently described how their company need to do multiple events from an external webhook.  Not enough people understand a simple web server so it got pushed to DevOps to build using salt.   Salt isn't a horrible answer but when he was telling me about this I could see a little of my inexperienced self in the story. </p>

<p>On another project I was dealing with an Indian iOS developer that needed to sort an array.   They fought me when I filed a bug that the sort order wasn't correct. A week later they had it working but had implement it in the worst way possible. They had pulled in SQLite as a new dependency and were using that to sort the array. When I saw this I was furious. They were very cheap agency but after this they weren't worth keeping around at <i>any</i> price. </p>

<p>In conclusion, we ended up implementing websockets. I was the champion for this feature and after our CTO guided me in the right direction. We read through the spec for websockets, we came up with the right fallback strategy, and the product improved significantly. We didn't have to blindly add dependencies, we understood the technology we wanted tovuse, and we found the right fit for our needs.

        <title>What is the weirdest bug you&#39;ve ever dealt with?</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I was asked this once at an informal interview and didn't have an immediate answer.  I told a story about the time I was trying to debug RF signals and the ultimate cause was that there was another remote using the same hardware ID.  It was extremely unprobabel, but it turned out to be the cause.</p>

<p>Since then I've had more time to reflect on how I would answer that question if I was asked again.</p>

<p>The weirdest bugs I've ever dealt with all have a common theme, distributed systems.  In my last two startups we have used distributed architectures.  This has caused somewhat simple tasks to become very difficult.</p>

<p>In the old days of a monolithic app server (Django, Rails, PHP) all the logs were in one place.  As you scaled you would need to add a load balancer and then spread the requests over multiple app servers.  Reasoning about the path an HTTP request took was still fairly simple.  At this level a relational database is perfectly able to handle the load.</p>

<p>In a distributed system, HTTP is used not just for the inital request but also for communication between servers.  This means you now have to deal with internal HTTP responses and they have different meansing from the external request/response that you're used to.  For example, what to do when an internal call to the cache returns a 401, 403, or 502?  Do the unauthorized/forbidden calls mean that the external's request is 401/403 or does this mean your app server is?  What about 502 Gateway Timeout?  You now have to deal with timing and latency between internal services.</p>

<p>Distributed computer and networking are a reality of life for most new projects.  It is something we'll have to learn and deal with.  In the meantime, it is also the source of my weirdest bugs.</p>

        <title>Leaving Eagle Eye and moving to HUVRdata</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I am excited to announce that I have accepted a new position with <a href="http://www.huvrdata.com">HUVRDATA</a>.  After an eight week transition I am thrilled to get started.  I wI'll be their CTO and will guide them into becoming the leader in drone based inspections.</p>

<p>It was surprisingly hard to leave Eagle Eye and specifically, let the team know what was next for me.  I lost sleep over this decision but we were able to make it through.  I loved working with them and it was filled with great memories.</p>

<p>I've been working with Bob and Ben at HUVR since the start of the year.  Things really kicked into gear when they closed a funding round in August.  Right now it is time to mash the accelerator and I would have regretted letting them go on without me.

        <title>Small Improvements Over Time</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Improving takes time and patience and lots of near-misses.  There is usually a narrow window in to capture the ideal scene and if you aren't in position and ready you will miss it.  I continue to be 10 minutes late, out of battery or space on the SD card when I realize this is the shot I wanted.</p>

<p>In this case, I wanted to try the waters before going again the next day.  The challenges of shooting downtime is that you attract too much attention to play around with expensive equipment as a crowd gathers.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Out on the a Bat Cruise</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I had a terrific time with <a href="https://twitter.com/LSRiverboat">@LSRiverboats</a> getting this footage.  This was captured in 4k@30fps but rendered to 720p for Vimeo.  The initial shot was digitally zoomed in and the reset is right off the camera.  Some minor exposure correction was done in post to make every match.</p>

<p>This was a lot of fun but extremely challenging to operate from a boat.  There were two boats, fading daylight, bats and other groups to contend with.  Thankfully everything worked out and I am happy with the results.</p>

        <title>Another Try at an Old Location</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This was taken out front of the Austin City Power Plant and is using the new manual camera controls of the Phantom 3 Pro.<p>

<p>It is hard to go back to past locations and try to get a fresh take.  The challenge is to that you are no longer looking at it with fresh eyes.  This is made worse if you liked the results from previous tries.</p>

<p>I am challenging myself to throw away my previous work.  All locations (except the Capital) are fair game.  I am also going to not get hung up on having done the shot before.  I will also shamelessly steal good ideas for others.  I am still in the beginner phase and am in no position to be selective.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Smooth Sailin&#39;</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This is video from my first flight with the new Phantom 3 Pro.  I picked it up earlier today and ran it through its paces.  So far, it is a significant improvement from the Phantom 2 Vision +.  The iOS app is the major differentiator.  All the other features are in support of the app.  The remote is the same as the Inspire 1 and feels much more refined.  Common features can be done using hard buttons and there is less time spent pawing at the app.  I am a big fan of physical buttons and not having to look at what I'm pushing.</p>

<p>I have (foolishly) upgraded my iPad Retina mini to beta versions of iOS 9.  The DJI app isn't playing nicely with the new HD video streaming.  I can't hold this against them.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Setbacks and Crashes</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an older video that I hadn't posted yet.  It is from a couple months ago and has nothing to do with the rest of the post.</p>

<p>I had a crash earlier in the week that has destroyed my Phantom 2.  Almost immediately after take it it lost all power and unceremoniously fell from the sky.  My first reaction was shock.  I don't know if the battery wasn't seated all the way or it experienced a different malfunction.<p>

<p>After some time to think, my shock turned to gratitude.  Gratitude that this wasn't over water, wasn't for a client, wasn't over a road, wasn't over a crowd.  I don't fly over crowds but it is always tempting to push the boundaries.</p>

<p>Pushing the boundaries is what makes this emerging field exciting.  Getting these images end of being expensive when you look at the output that gave from the money invested.</p>

<p>I can't wait to announce my next aircraft.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[The goal was to make  a short compilation from several different shots.   I wanted something visually interesting without spending hours on each shot. This was all done on just one battery.  Except for the last shot, we only took one pass at each shot and didn't review anything.

I had several more shots in mind, but will save those for another compilation.  I enjoying improvising and the preasure of just starting the camera. ]]></description>

        <title>Sunrise Panorama</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
This is a composite image from several individual shots.  It was taken a peaceful Sunday morning just after sunrise.  I really enjoy Sunday mornings photo shoots.  Austin is still recovering from its collective hangover, the roads are empty, and the sun isn't scorching hot, yet.
</p>

<p>
There is something more challenging about get a sunrise picture.  Sunsets are easy, I can tell how the sunset will turn out on my drive home.  There is a very little risk that the weather will change between packing up setting up.  On the downside, flying at sunset garners more attention and then you are working home in the dark (with expensive equipment).
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, after a nice Sunday morning out flying you can always get breakfast tacos on the way back to bed.  Let me know if you are interested in this image.

        <title>Making Progress</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
I'm starting to make progress with my ariel photography.  The images and video are making me cringe less.  I'm starting very basic and working up slowly.  Instead of just cranking up fancy effects in LightRoom or adding some razzle-dazzle from Final Cut Pro.  Right now  it is about making something that works well as Desktop wallpaper.
</p>

<p>
This blog is the new starting point for a gallery.  The goal is more about progress instead of a store of available prints.  (That's not to stay I won't sell out and turn this into a store).  If there is something that catches your fancy, fell free to reach out.

        <title>Putting in the hours</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the great advantages to sharing your beginner work is that you are able to see rapid progress.  The initial learning curve is usually pretty quick.  Making a <a href="https://vimeo.com/mcotton">Vimeo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyxtGx6qFvWv9S-rv19YzEA">YouTube</a>  channel and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/mcottondesign/submitted/">posting to reddit</a> provide quick feedback.  A lot of the feedback will be critical of what you are doing, but this is all part of learning.</p>

<p>Once you reach a certain level of achievement you reach a plateau and growth levels off.  This is usually a key area  of attrition.  The funnel tightens and many people are happy to stop getting better.  It is important to identify what the next achievement will look like and keep moving towards it.  For me, it was being included in an actual video production.</p>

        <title>Picking a new hobby and starting over</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying out a new hobby, that has been a casual interest of mine.  This year is going to be the year of GoPro photography.  It is a kind of weird idea, but the idea is really simple.  I've bought  the Hero 4 Black so there isn't a better model I can blame  for my shortcomings.  There is also a wide enough group of users posting their content that I have a significant yard stick to compare myself to. </p>

<p>What have I learned so far?</p>

<p>I've learned that it is easy to have an opinion about what looks good but it is very hard to produce something that I am proud to share.  This is the challenge of creative work.  My initial work is an embarrassment so far.  It is well below the standard I want to produce but this is exactly the point.</p>

<p>What do I want to get out of this?</p>

<p>I want to  produce work that I am proud to share.  Also, I want to be more comfortable sharing my work.  Expanding the things I am comfortable doing without much notice is a sign that I'm progressing towards being an interesting human being.</p>

<p>The same things that hold me back from dancing at weddings are the same things that hold me back with my creative work.  This way I'll have something interesting to show people who are also not dancing at weddings.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Translating text in Backbone.js templates</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>We recently added Japanese support to our webapp.  When implementing it, we decided on the most straight-forward method of converting it at run-time by adding a helper method to the view.</p>

<p>The first step was to extend Backbone.View to include a translate method (abbreviated as 't' to reduce noise in the template).  It performs a simple dictionary lookup.  It falls back to English if a suitable translation can not be found.</p>

<pre><code>BaseView = Backbone.View.extend({
     t: function(str, skip) {
        // check if the browser/system language is Japanese
        var lang = 'ja'
        var dictionary = {
                'US': {},
                'ja': {
                    'Dashboard': 'ダッシュボード',
                    'Layouts': 'レイアウト',
                    'Cameras': 'カメラ',
                    'Users': 'ユーザー',
                    'Map': 'マップ',
                    'Installer Tools': 'インストールツール',
                    'Status': '状態'
                }
        }

        return dictionary[lang][str]== undefined ? str : dictionary[lang][str];
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>And the specific view needs to be changed.</p>

<pre><code>AddCameraMessageView = Backbone.View.extend({
</code></pre>

<p>gets changed to be</p>

<pre><code>AddCameraMessageView = BaseView.extend({
</code></pre>

<p>The individual templates now can use the new translate helper method on any string.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Device&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Status&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>gets changed to be</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= this.t('Device') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= this.t('Name') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= this.t('Status') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The next iteration will perform this translation at the build phase by writing a grunt plugin instead of at run-time.  This will remove any rendering time penalty for our users.</p>]]></description>

        <title>How I use Frontend build tools and Grunt.js</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Build tools are traditionally the realm of backend systems.  Recently, as frontend systems have gotten more complex, JavaScript specific tools have emerged.  There are plenty of options and it would be impossible to keep up with them all.  I wanted to explain how we make use of <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt.js</a> and what it does for us.</p>

<h4>What are Frontend build tools</h4>

<p>There are several tasks that need to be done before releasing a modern webapp.  The JavaScript needs to be concatenated into a single file to improve page speed.  This should also be done with the CSS and all assets should be gzipped.  Files should be minified and uglified as appropiate and in the case of html, prettyprinted.</p>

<h4>Concatenating Files</h4>

<p>Web browsers download all the included script files before parsing and evaluating them.  It is best to have the least number of includes and the smallest includes possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in order to develop between team members and keep organized, it is best to break separate code into separate files.  Combining them all when getting ready for a release could be a tedious and error-prone process.  This is something that Grunt.js excels at.  Using the standard 'concat' task you can specify the files and order that you'd like them mashed together.  Doing this from the start lets you use the samething in development that you'll release in production.</p>

<p>We breakout our JavaScript into separate folders and then have an individual file for each 'class'.  All the Views get rolled together along with Models, Collections, Templates and dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>JS Folder
   |
   |- Views
   |    |
   |    |- AccountSummaryView.js
   |    |- AccountView.js
   |    |- AddAccountView.js
   |    |- AddNewCameraView.js
   |    |- ...
   |
   |- Models
   |    |
   |    |- Account.js
   |    |- Bridge.js
   |    |- Camera.js
   |    |- ....
   |
   |- ...
</code></pre>

<p>This all becomes</p>

<pre><code>JS Folder
   |
   |- backbone.views.js
   |- backbone.models.js
   |- ...
</code></pre>

<p>and then those become</p>

<pre><code>JS Folder
   |
   |- backbone.combined.js
</code></pre>

<p>This strategy also makes it easy to stuff templates into the index.html page so they are already in the DOM and speed up selector time.</p>

<h4>Cache Busting</h4>

<p>One of the problems with using the same file names is that the browser is cache the files.  Some browser are more aggressive about caching then others.  This is great for files that don't change but for your new concatenated file it is very frustrating.  Thanksfully <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt.js</a> has a hashres module that will look at your index.html and push a file hash into the file name.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="_js/backbone.combined.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>turns into </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="_js/backbone.combined_58cde93c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is terrific because as files are combined and generated only truely unique files will bust the cache.  Nginx is smart enough to filter out the hash in the filename and serve the correct file but the browser will think it new and different.</p>

<h4>Watching for changes</h4>

<p>All of this functionality would be ignored if you had to tab over to the console and re-run the grunt command over and over.  Included with <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt.js</a> is the watch module that lets you define the file patterns that it should watch.  When the files change it will automagically run the grunt tasks and you can safely forget about it.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>There is a lot more to learn about <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt.js</a>, hopefully this has got you excited.  Go dig in and try it out.</p>]]></description>

        <title>First Demo of my RFID integration</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>In order to show off the <a href="http://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com">EEN API</a> I made an example access control system out of a Raspberry PI, RFID reader and Node.js</p>

<p>Node.js was a natural fit for this project because of how easy it is to handle events from the RFID reader, add realtime support through websockets and pull data out of Eagle Eye Networks with the <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/node-een">een module</a>.</p>

<p>All the important changes can be made from config.js in the root directory.  From there you can define badges and doors.  Each door has its own reader which is defined by the serial port it is connected to.  The doors define the rules of which badges are authorized to open.  Adding time checks would be trivial to extend.</p>

<p>On startup it opens the serial ports and begins listening for strings that match the know badge format.  Next, it starts a webserver and waits for a websocket connection from a client.  Once the client connects it sends the current state to allow the client to get in sync.</p>

<p>New events are realtime, the template is rendered on the client to keep server traffic down.  The timestamp is recorded and a preview image is fetched.  The internal webserver acts as a authentication proxy for images and videos.  The image and video link could then be saved for further processing.</p>

<p>You can find the project on github here: <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/node-rfid">node-rfid</a></p>]]></description>

        <title>JavaScript Journal - Getting Started with Infinite Scrolling</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Infinite scrolling is a really cool effect and a great use of AJAX.  It also has some weird side-effects that you'll need to be aware of.  This is the starting point I used in the event version of the Gallery Viewer.  The major parts are throttling the scroll event and detecting the scrolling direction.  Because I am loading images I want to get started on the request as soon as possible, or I would wait until they were close to the bottom of the page before loading.  There is a also a little <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a message that keeps jumping to the bottom of the page.</p>

<pre><code>    // keep scroll position so we can use it 
    // later to detect scroll direction
    var oldScrollPosition = 0;

    // throttle down the scroll events to once ever 1.5 seconds
    var throttled = _.throttle(function(e) {
        var newScrollPosition = $(this).scrollTop();
        // check if they scrolled down the page
        if(newScrollPosition &gt; oldScrollPosition) {
            self.pullVideoList(self.num);
            oldScrollPosition = newScrollPosition;
        }
    }, 1500);
    $(window).scroll(throttled);
</code></pre>]]></description>

        <title>Working with the API: getting previews</title>
        <description><![CDATA[				      <h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>This blog post is an example of how you can use the Eagle Eye Networks <a href="http://apidocs.eagleeyenetworks.com">API</a> to embed the preview stream where ever you want.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>The API makes it very easy to get the preview stream for all the cameras in an account.  The preview stream is a series of JPEG images and requires authentication.  Our code today will show how to use the API to provide the images on a webpage without authentication.</p>

<h4>Step 1:</h4>

<p>We are going to use the code at <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/watcher">mcotton/watcher</a> to run a Node.js server that will login, subscribe to the poll stream, notify the client and proxy the image requests.  We could remove the poll stream to make the example very basic but it is worth going through it now.</p>

<p>Download or clone the <a href="https://github.com/mcotton/watcher">git repository</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 2:</h4>

<p>You will need to have <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> installed (current version is v0.10.26).  Once it is installed, open up the command line in the same directory as the example code, you can install the dependencies by running </p>

<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>

<p>Edit the file named <code>config.js</code>, replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your username and password</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
    username   =       'your_username',
    password   =       'your_password'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file and start the server</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<h4>Step 3:</h4>

<p>You can now open a browser at go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a> and you will see previews show up as the become available on the server.</p>

<p>Because we are subscribed to the poll stream we are only fetching previews when they are available.  This makes it very efficient with the bandwidth.</p>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>

<p>You can now treat the image URLs just like static assets on your server.  You can put it behind your own firewall or you can make it publicly available.  In both cases your username and password are safely stored on the server and never sent to the client.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Getting updated properties</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to get an updated property .  In this case, I am animating an image to make it 10% bigger when I hover over it.  I also have a slider that allows the grid sizing to change.</p>

<pre><code>$(img.currentTarget).animate({
    'position': 'absolute',
    'height': (function() { return $('#slider').slider('value') * 1.1 + '%' })(),
    'width': (function() { return $('#slider').slider('value') * 1.1 + '%' })(),
    'z-index': '10',
    'margin': '-15px -15px -15px -15px'},
    0,
    function() {}
})
</code></pre>

<p>Here I am replacing a static property with a function that can return new information.  It is still accessed in the same way but behaves the way I wanted.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Making a wireless security system</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Our condo recently had some flood damaged and their are workers coming in and out to do repairs.  My wife and I both work and do not feel comfortable with strangers in our house without us.  We don't have the needed wiring in our hallway and my wife didn't want to see any wires run down the wall.  So I made a wired camera wireless with parts I had laying around.</p>

<p>First I needed a wireless to wired bridge.  There are several specialty parts available that do this but one of the cheapest and easiest to use is the Apple Airport Express.  When you join it to a wireless networks, the ethernet port becomes a LAN port. <br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8898Lkk.jpg" alt="Airport Express" title="" width="300" /></p>

<p>I also had an older Axis M1011 wired camera.  Any IP camera will work through the wireless bridge, but make sure you have a way to power it. <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aVI3oTj.jpg" alt="Axis M1011" title="" width="300" /></p>

<p>You can use the Axis clamp bracket and the power supply to power and mount the unit.  Plug it all in and it will work just as if it were wired. <br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EpTiTjc.jpg" alt="finished back view" title="" width="300" /> <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zdBI5Bs.jpg" alt="finished front view" title=""  width="300" /> <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gyw1OzP.png" alt="finished front view" title=""  width="600" /></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I absolutely love <a href="http://toys.usvsth3m.com/javascript-under-pressure/">you can't javascript under presurre</a> and will be using it next time I am interviewing someone.  It is really just fizzbuzz with a couple really easy problems thrown in up-front.</p>

<p>It isn't really about the total time the applicant gets, its more about how they approach the problems and then how they refine their solution when they are given more time.</p>

<p>I approached them using a simple for loop but given more time I would refactor the code to use forEach and/or reduce.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Multi-threaded JavaScript (sort of)</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>[UPDATE: It turns out that we could make a simple change on the server and remove the need for this code to run client-side.  There was nothing wrong with the approach we took in the article, but decided to do it on the server as an enhancement to our API]</p>

<p>I just got through experimenting with web workers and pushed it out to production.  Now its time to explain what I've learned.</p>

<p>To see historicaly videos and events, we launch a new window called the history browser.  It uses SVG to create tiles, these tiles are draggable and vary in size depending on the zoom level.</p>

<p>When zooming out to the week view (each tile represents 24 hours of activity) We are making several requests for days and the resulting JSON can be several MBs.  </p>

<p>We then need to coalesce those activity segments into a single video recording.  This loop is where JavaScript really slows down. [Looping through 5000 records, reducing it down to ~500]</p>

<p>By using a seperate thread we can do the hard work without making the UI unresponsive.</p>

<pre><code>worker = new Worker('../_js/workers/coalesce.js');
worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) {}, false);

worker.postMessage({ 'name': 'Mr. Orange' })
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've had your fun, the <code>worker</code> sends a <code>self.postMessage(msg)</code> back to the main thread.</p>

<p>In both cases, the <code>message</code> listener function is passed the event object.  The actual data can be reached using <code>e.data</code>.</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on what the worker can access, the main restrictions are: </p>

<ul>
<li>window</li>
<li>document</li>
<li>the DOM</li>
<li>complex objects* </li>
</ul>

<p>Objects are strigified, then passed as strings.  Be aware of this so you don't get various errors thrown.  Objects are passed-by-copy instead of reference so there is a performance hit when sending data back and forth.</p>

<p>It is up to you as a developer to understand the perfocmance implicatons of using web workers.  I wouldn't spin up a web worker everytime I need to add two numbers, so make a try them out and see where they can be deployed wisely.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Since I had to install this on two different machines I thought I'd be nice and leave this for someone else to find.</p>

<p>I store custom compiled stuff  in ~/src but you can put it anywhere you'd like</p>

<pre><code>cd src
curl -O <a href='http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.6.14.tar.gz'>http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.6.14.tar.gz</a>
tar zxvf redis-2.6.14.tar.gz
cd redis-2.6.14
make
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /Users/cotton/src/redis-2.6.14/src/redis-server redis-server
ln -s /Users/cotton/src/redis-2.6.14/src/redis-cli redis-cli
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can start up the redis-server in any directory (as long as you have /usr/local/bin in your path) using <br /><code>redis-server &amp;</code></p>

<p>And opening the client is as easy as<br /><code>redis-cli</code></p>]]></description>

        <title>My Merging Strategy</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my current merging strategy and workflow.  I have the branch <code>mcotton-next</code> and when I make new features I <code>git checkout -b mcotton-branch-name</code></p>

<p>As I make changes I make incremental commits and run grunt.  I use this command <code>grunt &amp;&amp; git status -s|awk '{ print $2 }'|xargs git add; git commit -m "&lt;commit message&gt;" &amp;&amp; git push stage mcotton-branch-name</code></p>

<p>Because I make a lot of little commits I use <code>git merge mcotton-branch-name --squash</code> so that I can make my own commit with a unified message.</p>

<p>After that I merge it to next and push to the next remote. <code>git merge mcotton-next</code>  <code>git push origin next</code> <code>git push next next</code></p>

<p>Once everything is tested and looks good, we <code>git merge next</code> into master, create a new tag <code>git tag &lt;data&gt;</code>, <code>git push origin master --tags</code> and then <code>git push prod master --tags</code> and <code>git push prev master --tags</code>.  </p>

<p>After that I remote to prod and prev and do a <code>git pull --all</code> then <code>git checkout &lt;date&gt;</code></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I sent out this email about a presentation I would be willing to give.</p>

<p>Are you interested in a node talk about camera uploads directly from iPhone to Node and then to S3?</p>

<p>Starting from nothing, then use </p>

<ul>
<li>Why use Node? Why make it async?</li>
<li>node-formidable to handle uploads</li>
<li>knox to upload to S3</li>
<li>router to make sensible URLs, structure for REST</li>
<li>nano to integrate with CouchDB</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the experience of the audience, I can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>socket.io integration for upload progress indicator</li>
<li>making a REST-ful interface</li>
<li>syncing backbone collections with REST-ful API</li>

        <title>JavaScript: quick debugging tip</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been doing a lot of in-browser testing.  Because of this I want an insight to what the browser is doing. </p>

<pre><code>console.log('DEBUG: ' + data)
</code></pre>

<p>But this gets unmanageable very quickly.  The next evolution is to place a flag for what should be logged.  It also helps to prefix all the logs with a category (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, etc)</p>

<pre><code>debug = true

if (debug) console.log('DEBUG: ' + data)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little better but still isn't that much better.  The next jump is to make debug into an object and get more specific about what I'm logging.</p>

<pre><code>debug = {
    'info':         false,
    'startup':      true,
    'route':        true,
    'error':        true,
    'ajax':         false
}


if (debug.startup) console.log('STARTUP':  initializing navigation view)
</code></pre>]]></description>

        <title>JavaScript Journal - Updating an image without flickering</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This is how I'm approaching the problem of trying to simulate live video from a series of preview images.</p>

<ul>
<li>After initial page setup, we start the polling service</li>
<li>After each polling response we look for new preview images ('pre')</li>
<li>For each preview response, we ask each camera to update its image</li>
<li>As an optimization we only update the cameras that are currently on screen</li>
<li>When the new image has loaded, we swap it with the one being displayed (this eliminates flickering)</li>
<li>If the image has taken longer than two seconds to load than display a 'Loading…'  message</li>
<li>Update the time display in the corner with the timestamp of the image</li>
</ul>

<p>I am made an updateImage method on my Cameras model.  When the new image is loaded into a dummy space, I copy it to the actual model's image and the view re-renders.</p>

<p>To eliminate the flickering, bind to the load event on the new image and wait unti it is fired before changing the src on the image.</p>

<p>I also added some convenience methods to the Collection.  I filter down the models based and return it based on status.  As long as I return an array of models everything else works.</p>]]></description>

        <title>JavaScript Journal - looping</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Depending on when you started learning JavaScript (and when you stopped keeping up) you might find a lot of this inside your code</p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0;i&lt;arr.length;i++) {
    html = "&lt;li&gt;" + arr[i] + "&lt;/li&gt;"
}
</code></pre>

<p>or if you started with jQuery you will have copy and pasted something like this from stackoverflow</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON(url, function(data) {
    $.each(data, function(item) {
        $('#thing').append('&lt;li&gt;' + item + '&lt;/li&gt;')
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>or you could be doing something like this and use a client-side templete,  Each model would get its own view</p>

<pre><code>LayoutView = Backbone.View.extend({

        events: {},

        tagName: 'div',

        className: 'een-camera-holder',

        template: _.template($('#LayoutView-template').html()),

        initialize: function() {
            this.model.bind('change', this.render, this)
        },

        render: function() {
            this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()))
            return this
        }

    })
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what will come next in ES6 but I'm sure this will need to be updated in 6 months with <code>let</code> and <code>yield</code></p>]]></description>

        <title>JavaScript Journal - Making a Single Page App </title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Right now I am in the process of creating a large, complex single page app.  Some of the challenges I am running through right now are rendering, user management and API proxying.</p>

<h3>client-side vs server-side rendering</h3>

<p>Traditionally the page would be rendered on the server.  When  a page changes the server renders it again and can always return the latest data.  You can then progressively enhance some of the data client-side to make it nicer.  Everything is just a refresh away.  There is very little state to manage.</p>

<p>Rendering it on the client-side means that the page does not get fully refresh.  The page is broken-up into separate views that can be updated and re-rendered in place.  View should be updated by changing the actual data and having the events bubble up.  </p>

<h3>user management</h3>

<p>Creating the app client-side raises some problems when it comes to authentication and authorization.  Because everything needs to comunicate with the server has to be sent to the client first.  We are using a server to provide a session cookie.  It sent with every request.</p>

<h3>API Proxying</h3>

<p>In order to make AJAX calls to the API server, we have to overcome the same origin policy problem.  In short, browsers limit javascript calls to any other than the originating domain.  I have decided to get around this by standing up another server that can proxy the API for me.  This strategy would also work if you wanted to integrate our platform into your existing webapp or if you have your own login system.  This is a fine solution if you have full-stack experience.</p>]]></description>

        <title>JavaScript Choices</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>On my current project, I would really like to move away from YUI and towards Backbone.js.  I am a believer in using a hybrid approach of the best components instead of using a single monolithic library.  </p>

<p>YUI is a large, heavy framework that enforces their way of development.  While their way isn't wrong, it does makes us beholden to Yahoo and their choices.  YUI has incorporated much of Backbone.js into their later releases but it is  significantly behind where Backbone.js is.   It is also forced into the existing YUI structure and conflicts with other YUI components.  While it does have good community support, it doesn't compare to the more mainstream libraries in the JavaScript community.</p>

<p>I want to move forward using a hybrid model.  We would choose the best components and keep our options open to better items as they develop.  I want to use Backbone.js for the app structure (models, views, router).  This lets us use jQuery for DOM manipulation and progressive enhancements (not app structure).  Our CSS will continue using Bootstrap components.</p>

<p>This is a lighter-weight approach, both in terms of library size and future development.</p>]]></description>

        <title>What I learned interviewing</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>October has been a very strange month and thankfully I came out of it better than I expected.  I had the chance to meet some great people.</p>

<h3>The Good</h3>

<p>Swift software had a great idea for the technical phone interview, the team reviewed a project of mine on github and then had me answer questions about it for an hour.  They prepared a follow-up assignment adding features to that project.</p>

<p>OKCupid Labs and CrowdFlower both had me pair-program with a team member and work a real bug on their actual codebase.  I really loved this, this was the most comfortable for me.</p>

<p>CrowdFlower had me bring my own laptop and gave me an hour to work on a representative problem.  They also had me sit with them through a lunch meeting and let me get deep into what they are doing.</p>

<p>Companies that had some some technical question or problem required before applying.  I enjoyed the problem with companies that kept the problem to less than 10 minutes of work.</p>

<h3>The Bad</h3>

<ul>
<li>Extended Comp Sci problems</li>
<li>Geometry problems</li>
<li>Implement shuffle function</li>
<li>Design full-stack for 50 million visitors per month (200 ms response time)</li>
<li>Companies that were disorganized or took three weeks to respond</li>
<li>Companies that has non-technical screeners try to ask technical questions</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bat-shit Crazy</h3>

<p>Several companies ask to complete excessive homework assignments (4-8 hours).  The worst offender asked me to complete a project in a foreign enviroment (Ruby on Rails) and then complete a project.  He wanted me to use even though he knew I wasn't familiar with it.  I very much liked the company otherwise.</p>

<h3>Conculsion</h3>

<p>I received a few offers and happily accepted a position with Eagle Eye Networks.  It was very difficult to make the decision and even harder to let the other people know.  I am very excited to be coding instead of interviewing.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Making Python and Django more social with awe.sm</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Our users like to share the deal they just received with their friends on Facebook.  We would like to know how well those links do and what kind of traffic they receive.  <a href="http://awe.sm">awe.sm</a> is a company that does exactly that.  This blog post is about showing how easy it is to integrate into python and Django.</p>

<pre><code>def facebook_share_checkin(checkin, points):
    try:
        # I removed the code for getting the user token
        graph = facebook.GraphAPI(token)

        # The facebook API specifies what they want as a payload
        attachment = dict()
        attachment['picture'] = consts.LOGO
        attachment['name'] = checkin.location.name
        msg = 'I just checked in at %s using Qliq' % checkin.location.name
        attachment['link'] = consts.SOCIAL_NETWORK_DEFAULT_LINK

        # Post it the the user's wall
        graph.put_wall_post(msg, attachment)

    except facebook.GraphAPIError as e:
        logger.exception('GraphAPIError')
    except SocialNetworkCredentials.DoesNotExist:
        logger.exception('Facebook credentials error')
</code></pre>

<p>This is real standard and nothing exciting.  The link we are sharing is the same for every user and comes from a file of constants.</p>

<pre><code>attachment['link'] = consts.SOCIAL_NETWORK_DEFAULT_LINK
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how we would use awe.sm to create a custom link per user and see how well that link does in the real world.</p>

<p>Just above the previous line we will make a network request to awe.sm with 5 parameters</p>

<pre><code>- v: this is ther version of the api we will be using
- url: this is our original url we were using
- key: this is our developer key
- tool: this is the id of the tool we are using
- channel: this is going to be `facebook-post`
</code></pre>

<p>Now we just need to make the request and using the great python <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests">requests</a>       library</p>

<pre><code>      r = requests.post('<a href='http://api.awe.sm/url.txt'>http://api.awe.sm/url.txt</a>',

        <title>Making a 3rd-party JavaScript widget</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>At QliqUp, we had the idea of making a widget that merchants could place into their existing webpage that would let them show the current deals they offer.  This was mostly straight forward but I wanted to explain some of the sharp edges that slowed us down.</p>

<p>You can see the final product at: <a href='http://qliqup.com/widgets/'>http://qliqup.com/widgets/</a></p>

<p>First we had to make a  public endpoint inside of our API.  I left out some the docstrings because it only cluttered this example.</p>

<pre><code>class PublicDealsHandler(BaseHandler):
    def read(self, request, response, id=''):

        if not id or id is '':
            return response.send(errors="Please specify a valid business", status=404)

        ret = []

        deals = Deal.objects.filter(business=id)
        for d in deals:
            ret.append({'name':d.business.name, 'data':d })

        response.set(deals=ret)
        return response.send()
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs JSON that looks like this (shortened down for this blog post):</p>

<pre><code>{
    "errors": [],
    "data": {
        "deals": [
            {
                "data": {
                    "qpoint_cost": 250,
                    "description": "Receive a free Appetizer from Sam's Burger Joint. ",
                    "never_expires": true,
                    "redeemed": 0,
                    "text": "Free Appetizer From Sam's Burger Joint!",
                    "expires": null,
                    "unlimited": false,
                    "limit": 100,
                    "purchased": 0,
                    "additional_details": "Free Appetizer From Sam's Burger Joint!",
                    "id": 104
                },
                "name": "Sam's Burger Joint"
            }
        ],
        "messages": []
    },
    "success": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now on the client side we need make a single script they could include.  We also had to wrap it up in a closure to keep things nice</p>

<pre><code>(function($) {

    var ss = document.createElement("link");
    ss.type = "text/css";
    ss.rel = "stylesheet";
    ss.href = "<a href='http://static.qliqup.com/qliq_deals/style.css'>http://static.qliqup.com/qliq_deals/style.css</a>";
    document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(ss);

    // regular jQuery goes here

})(jQuery)
</code></pre>

<p>And now you can include it with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="<a href='http://static.qliqup.com/qliq_deals/script.js'>http://static.qliqup.com/qliq_deals/script.js</a>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I am trying to get some test for our code base that doesn't have any.  None at all.  There isn't even a documented test plan.</p>

<p>Because the API server is the core of our porduct, and because testing RESTful things is easier, we'll start by making a JavaScript tester.  And because a webpage is friendlier that a command-line, it'll report in the browser.</p>

        <title>Making profile pages more sane</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>We encourage our merchants to include a facebook page with their profiles so that users can share that page when they check-in, check-out, unlock a deal, or redeem a deal.  But some people didn't understand what that means and we had all sorts of crazy input.  Instead of explaining the steps they'll need to get us the correct URL, we'll just take whatever they mashed out on their keyboard and fix it.</p>

<p>Django has some weird points, but it mostly has awesome ones.  I needed to clean up our database and the interactive console was perfect.</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py shell
</code></pre>

<p>and then you can something like this</p>

<pre><code># get all the businesses from the modal
b = Business.objects.all()


# loop through the all the profiles
for p in b:      
    p.facebook_link = p.facebook_link.replace('<a href='http://www.facebook.com'>http://www.facebook.com</a>','')
    p.facebook_link = p.facebook_link.replace('/facebook.com','/')
    p.facebook_link = p.facebook_link.replace('<a href='https://www.facebook.com'>https://www.facebook.com</a>','')
    p.facebook_link = p.facebook_link.replace('//','/')
    p.save()
</code></pre>

<p>On the signup form we do some JavaScript to parse out some of the non-sense</p>

<pre><code>$('#facebook').blur(function() {
     $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/^.*\//,''))
})

$('#twitter').blur(function() {
     $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/^[@]/,''))
})
</code></pre>]]></description>

        <title>Making user logins more forgiving</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>We are currently working on making our login system more forgiving.   We started by creating usernames, and then people forgot their usernames so we now we are wanting to use e-mail addresses as usernames.  This is great except for the users who remember their username.</p>

<p>We decided to try logging in assuming they gave us a username, if that fails, try it again matching against their email.</p>

<p>While we are at it we also smush everything down to lowercase so that we can eliminate some typos.  We are don't differentiate 'Bob' and 'bob'.</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table set email = LOWER(email);

<li>Create a master password.</li>
<li>Create entries, for existing passwords you'll need to edit the generated password</li>
<li>Save it to a file and place in your <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> folder</li>
<li>Install and login into <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8">Dropbox</a> on your iPhone</li>

<li>Open the encrypted keepass database on your phone from Dropbox.</li>
<li>It won't be able to display anything, but the 'action arrow' button and choose to open it with MiniKeePass</li>
<li>MiniKeePass will open and you'll be able to decrypt the archive with your master password.</li>

        <title>Got a problem, python is usually the answer</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>We had an emergency where our EMR provider isn't output the needed government reports.  This wouldn't be such a big deal if they weren't due on Monday.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be with the XML records and some information needed to be striped out and manually looked at.</p>

<p>Thankfully python has easy installers for Windows and the standard lib includes xml parsing and csv output.</p>

<pre><code>##########################################

# Simple use:

# creates a file named out.csv

import os, glob
from xml.dom.minidom import parseString, parse
import csv

def pullInfo(fileName):
  """ Gets information from Aprima xml file"""

  datasource = open(fileName)

  dom = parse(datasource)

  firstName = dom.getElementsByTagName('given')[0].toxml()
  firstName = firstName.replace('&lt;given&gt;','').replace('&lt;/given&gt;','')

  city = city.replace('&lt;city&gt;','').replace('&lt;/city&gt;','')

  state = dom.getElementsByTagName('state')[0].toxml()
  state = state.replace('&lt;state&gt;','').replace('&lt;/state&gt;','')

  postalCode = dom.getElementsByTagName('postalCode')[0].toxml()    
  postalCode = postalCode.replace('&lt;postalCode&gt;','').replace('&lt;/postalCode&gt;','')

  patient = [firstName, lastName, street, city, state, postalCode]

  return patient


# Example path on windows
# path = 'C:\\Users\\mcotton\\Desktop\\xml'

path = './'
output = 'out.csv'

writer = csv.writer(open (output, 'wb'))

for infile in glob.glob( os.path.join( path, '*.*')):
  writer.writerow( pullInfo( infile) )

<p>Yay! for python</p>]]></description>

<p>When I restart my HP N40L it does not always recognize both drives.  ESXi is on a thumbdrive and has not problem booting.  Because the two physical drives are seperate datastores hosting different VMs it leaves my system in a in consistent place on restart.</p>

        <title>How to replicate ubuntu vm on ESXi</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to deploy multiple copies of a base ubuntu server, easy right?</p>

<p>Well it is now, but it took me a while to get it right.  The whole problem comes from not having 'sysprep' for linux.  (They probably have a much better way and I just don't know it).  Because ESXi makes up a fake MAC address for the network interface, it is smart enough to make up a new MAC for the new machine.  Your old VM is still expecting the old network settings and needs a minor change.  I'm not changing the hostname, ssh keys, users, or any of that other jazz; just getting the network up and running.</p>

<ul>
<li>browse the datastore</li>
<li>find the Ubuntu directory</li>
<li>make a new folder</li>
<li>copy the VM to the new folder</li>
<li>right click on the vmx file and 'add it to inventory'</li>
<li>start the new VM</li>
<li>vSphere will ask if you moved or copied it, answer that you copied it</li>
<li>log into your new VM from the console</li>
<li>figure out what the new interface is: ifconfig -a | grep 'eth'</li>
<li>it will most likely be eth1</li>
<li>sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces and change eth0 to the new interface eth1</li>
<li>save, reboot</li>
</ul>

<p>You know have a clone of the first machine with a new MAC and IP address.   I will revise this as I learn more and my process becomes more automated.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Finally got it working</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I finally got my HP Proliant N40L doing something useful.</p>

<p>Except for trying something new, it only runs a single instance of windows 7.  I have it configured as two logical drives residing on a single 2TB disk.  In my testing I had better performance keeping both logical drives on the same disk.  Weird, it shouldn't work like that but it does.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to stream movies from iTunes until I tried a million things, the last being adding a new ethernet card as a VMXNET3 instead of E1000.</p>

<p>It is currently able to stream a movie to the appletv while uTorrent grabs more content.  Handbrake is also crunching away at the completed downloads and getting them ready for iTunes.</p>

<p>I am still trying to understand what windows is doing with the 7GB of RAM I gave it.  Using the performance monitor I haven't ever seen it go above 2.41.  Usually it doesn't go about 1GB.  The memory usage stays consistant so it must be doing something.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A home server seems like such a good idea, until you get one and wonder, what the hell am I going to do with this?</p>

<p>RIght now I have an instance of Windows 7 running iTunes to sync with the AppleTVs.  This was harder than it should be because I couldn't add anything to the library without the system thinking it had a sound card.  I found something to fake it and now it works.</p>

<p>Amahi is a really light Linux implementation of WHS2011.  It is the network share that I am storing my iTunes library.  This makes it accessible from all over.</p>

<p>Still not sure what else to do with it </p>]]></description>

        <title>HP Proliant Microserver N40L</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>My wife bought me a new toy yesterday. A HP Proliant Microserver N40L.  I upgraded the RAM (8GB) and after some fighting, installed ESXi from a USB drive.  The fighting was because of installing from a USB drive, ESXi recognized all the hardware just fine.</p>

<p>I intend on running it headless, so I am using a tv as a monitor.  My little sharp LCD only had dvi.  My Samsung plasma has vga, but I can't turn off the power saving mode and it goes to sleep whenever it loses video signal.  This means that during a reboot the screen powers down and takes ~5 seconds to come back on.  It is really annoying when I was trying to figure out how to get into the BIOS.</p>

<p>I don't know what I am going to use it for other than getting more VMWare experience.  I would like to run FreeNAS and Win7 (or Server 2008R2).  If nothing else, I can use so of the dev boards I have lying around (phidgets, netburner, synapse-wireless).</p>]]></description>

        <title>Installing VMWare ESXi</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I have wanted to install ESXi for a long time now, thankfully we have a spare Dell PowerEdge 1950 for me to use.</p>

<p>I am going to install FreeNAS and pfSense to get the hang of using it.  Later I will install some real machines.</p>

<p>Here is a quick audio-less screencast showing how to connect with the vSphere client and create a new virtual machine.</p>

        <title>Adventures in IT</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>We have an older medical office that we need to upgrade.  It is using XP as a server and several Win2000 boxes as the clients.  The practice management software is not compatible with Windows 7.  We couldn't upgrade the software nor could we downgrade the new boxes to XP.</p>

<p>I suggest VMWare (my answer for most everything lately) but this time Microsoft's Virtual PC and XP mode came to the rescue.  We were able to test and configure the first machine, shut it down, save it to a network share and copy it to the other machines. </p>

<p>We were able to get a shortcut of the XP Mode application on the host's desktop, connect to a network printer and then still get better performance than before.</p>

<p>I still haven't learned to use sysprep but was able to make it work.  Thumbs up to Virtual PC.</p>]]></description>

        <title>How to write a bookmarklet</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Problem</strong>:  I have to use a punch clock webapp for work.  It doesn't have jQuery already included and I would like it to work from the iPhone.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:  Write a bookmarklet in javascript.   Fill-in the text fields and click the submit button.</p>

<pre><code>(function(){  
  // Grab the username and password input fields
  user = document.getElementById('txtUserName'); 
  pass = document.getElementById('txtPassword');

  // Grab the submit button, oddly named 'punch'
  punch = document.getElementById('btnPunch'); 

  // Assign them values and simulate clicking the 'punch' button
  user.value = 'foo'; 
  pass.value = 'bar';
  punch.click()

// Wrap it up in parens so it is a self-calling function
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Now you need to make a new bookmark and edit the URL to look like this:</p>

<pre><code> javscript:&lt;function goes here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In mobile safari, use the action button (square box with an arrow escaping) to add the original URL to your home screen.  Once the page loads you will open up your saved bookmarks and choose this bookmarklet.  You can find it and fork it on github [<a href='https://gist.github.com/1332353'>https://gist.github.com/1332353</a>]</p>]]></description>

        <title>Technical questions</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are some interview questions, when I'm back from vacation I'll have proper examples</p>

<h3>write out a dog class in JavaScript with a color property and a bark method</h3>

<p><code><br />var Dog = function(color)  {<br />    this.color = color;<br />    this.bark = function() {<br />        console.log('woof');<br />    }<br />};<br /></code></p>

<p>If I wanted to create a new dog <br /><code><br /> var clarence = new Dog('black and white');<br /></code><br />and if I wanted to add an eat method to the Dog class.  This is will add it for all previously defined instances of the Dog class.</p>

<p><code><br />Dog.prototype.eat = function()  { <br />    console.log('yum yum yum'); <br />};<br /></code></p>

<h3>jQuery.live() vs jQuery.delegate()</h3>

<p><code><br />$('#profs li').live("click", function() {<br />    alert('clicked');<br />});<br /></code><br />vs</p>

<p><code><br />$('#profs').delegate("li", "click", function() {<br />    alert('clicked');<br />});<br /></code></p>

<p>They both provide the same functionality, but the difference is that live() attaches to the document.  </p>

<h3>implement jQuery.delegate() in pure JavaScript</h3>

<p><code><br />function doSomething() {<br />    alert('click');<br />}<br /></code><br /><code><br />ul = document.getElementById('profs');<br />ul.addEventListener('click', doSomething, false);<br /></code></p>

<p>I didn't know the syntax for addEventListener().  Once I looked that up it was extremely simple.</p>

<h3>custom event listeners in JavaScript</h3>

<p>This is another one I needed to look up.  I'll need to look at it more to understand it better.  Unfortunately it is different in Node.js, socket.io, and CouchDB.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Google App Engine Changes</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently Google announced that Google App Engine is leaving preview.  Along with a SLA they are also putting their pricing into effect.  There has been a lot of speculation, but no one knows for sure how things will keep playing out.</p>

<p>What does this mean for mcottondesign?  It means that even if everything stays the same, now would be a good time to re-write this blog in Node.js and CouchDB on EC2.  I have already shown how to make an all javascript blog in my screencast series with the same name.</p>

<p>It also means that I no longer have a good place to run python on the back-end.  Django seems too heavy and abstracted, WebApp was a great little framework that I really enjoyed using.  I will have to look at Twisted to see how I like it.</p>

<p>This also means that my github projects (this blog, among others) aren't as appealing.  It was really fun to be able to tell people to just download the latest and they would be running in 30 seconds.</p>

<p>I really enjoy developing for Google App Engine.  I hope that the free quotas remain generous and performance doesn't suffer.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Two Great Quotes</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<br />-- Theodore Roosevelt</p>

<p>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which unskilled people make poor decisions and reach erroneous conclusions, but their incompetence denies them the metacognitive ability to appreciate their mistakes.[1] The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their ability as above average, much higher than it actually is, while the highly skilled underrate their own abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority. Actual competence may weaken self-confidence, as competent individuals may falsely assume that others have an equivalent understanding. As Kruger and Dunning conclude, "the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others" (p. 1127). (from wikipedia)</p>]]></description>

        <title>Trying and getting rejected</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Most instances in life you will get what you want.  You will not starve to death, freeze in the cold, or be eaten by velociraptors.</p>

<p>You will get a job doing something close to what you love, and be paid enough to buy lots of stuff.  You will find friends, even if they are just co-workers or that drive-through girl who gives you extra fries.  You will have a good life.  </p>

<p>But every now and again, you will try for something more.  You will try and stretch for the next step up.  You will get excited and hopeful and...</p>

<p><em>It won't work out</em>.</p>

<p>You will be mad and depressed and frustrated.  You won't want to give up.  You will spend time thinking about what could have been.</p>

<p>Or you can just move on.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[				      <p>This week's screencast is about creating a local module to store your private settings.  This is important because you don't want user:pass and IP addresses stored in git or github.</p>

        <title>Why would you write something if no one will use it?</title>
        <description><![CDATA[It is easy to get caught up with the web trends and forget about shipping products.  This happens to me all the time.  I have a hard drive full of prototypes and concepts, yet my github account is really sparse.</p>
<p>I'm still going to program in my off-hours, but now will document the changes I make.  I already announced my goal of one screencast a week to be posted to this blog.  Instead of starting new projects I am going to fork existing projects, build out more thorough examples and submit them back.  I'll update libraries as needed to make my examples work.</p>
<p>2011 is going to be a very public year for me and I look forward to it.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Latest experiment</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I decided to venture out to the scary world of Amazon Web Services. I am far enough along that it makes sense to update this blog about my experience. </p> <p>I am working with Couchdb and Node.js. I love couch and so far, really enjoy node. I'm deploying this on ubuntu (which is always awesome) on ec2. My current workflow goes like this.. <ul> <li>Reboot in ubuntu</li> <li>Make changes to my app, commit and push from git</li> <li>ssh into ec2, pull from git</li> <li>enjoy</li> </ul> <p>It is as similar to app engine as I could make it. I'm sure going with a provider like heroku or webbynode with iron out the remain hiccups, but I am content with it. Node, couch, cloud, git, I think I have caught up to the cool kids from last year.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Thoughts on the iPad and Home Automation</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I love my iPad and it continues to make me smile when I use it.  I like it more than my iPhone (if I didn't need to program, I would say more than my macbook).<p>
<p>Since crestron has released a mobile app for it, I have been working on finding how it fits into the home automation landscape.  I don't want to endless speculate on it fixing all the world's problems, or how it will be cause the end of other touchscreens. But I will say, that seeing what other designers have been able to create with it leads me to believe that my work is terrible.</p>
<p>I plan to update this blog with screenshots and examples.  Hopefully I'll get better along the way</p>]]></description>

        <title>IPad review</title>
        <description><![CDATA[I have my new iPad and I love it.   It might my not be as magical as apple claims, but it is innovative. It it a toy and not a serious computer. As long as you expect it to be beautiful it won't disappoint.  For the same price as a net book it is a great purchase   I have shown it some customers and  the real test will be how I can deploy it into the custom installation market.

        <title>Bug in XPanel kiosk mode</title>
        <description><![CDATA[It took way too long but I found a solution for the xpanel kiosk mode bug.<br>
I was having a weird issue with 'phantom' button clicks when it was in kiosk mode.  The problem went away if I put it in full-screen.<br>
After some tinkering and google-ing the problem here are the new xpanel.ini settings.<br>
<ul>
<li>left=-4
<li>top=-50
<li>right=1028
<li>bottom-772
</ul>
That completely fills the screen at 1024x768]]></description>

        <title>Haven&#39;t we seen this management style before?</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Here are some guidelines from a WW2 manual on sabotage.  It sounds like people I have worked with in the past.<br>
<ul>
<li> Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
</li><li>Make “speeches.” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of per  sonal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate “patriotic” comments.
</li><li> When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and considera tion.” Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five.
</li><li> Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
</li><li> Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
</li><li> Advocate “caution.” Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reason able” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</li>
</ul><br>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm very excited to start with a series of post about working with Google App Engine.</p>
<p>I'm planning on showing code samples of reducing server load through memcache, creating mashups with other services through urlfetch and JSON, and reducing initial (cold start) page loads through AJAX.</p>
<p>Stay tumed for code samples and instructions.</p>]]></description>

        <title>What you need to know about your electrical plan</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>
In the excitement of building a new house it is easy to gloss over some of the finer details.  You should take care that your electrical system doesn't get forgotten about.  Your builder has an electrician that he uses, and there is good reason they work together, but just because he is working on your house doesn't mean he is working for you.  He won't be able to read your mind and so I've put together a list of things you should discuss.

<p><h5>1. Outlets, Outlets, Outlets</h5>
In a well designed home you don't need to plug everything into a single outlet.  You should start with what the local, state and nation electrical codes say and then add more outlets everywhere you need them.  If you have a doubt, add it.

<p><h5>2. Flat panel TVs and art lights</h5>
When you mount a tv on the wall, you'll need to determine how to plug it in.  Make sure you plan ahead and have an electrician add a outlet at the correct height.  If you aren't sure which wall it will go on, you can have a regular outlet installed on the bottom of the wall and have them add another outlet later.  To make this easier for them, add an outlet inside the correct "stud bay" so they don't have to drill through the framing.  If you're unsure, your builder or low-voltage designer can assist you.

<p><h5>3. Floor plugs and lamps</h5>
In a typical living room layout it is wise to consider outlets installed in the floor.  Most people will have a couch with lamps on either side, and those lamps need electricity.  You can have the floor plug placed under the couch and the lamp cords will no longer be a tripping hazard.  As with regular outlets, more is better.  Measure two-thirds the distance of the room from the fireplace or entertainment center.

<p><h5>4. Breaker Panels and printed labels</h5>
Look at a completed home your builder did and check to see if you can read the labels in the breaker panel.  Are they clear?  Can you tell which circuits control the various items?  Having clearly labeled breaker panels makes service easier when you need it.  Have the electrician write the labels while it is fresh in his memory and then apply new printed labels when the house is ready to close.  Check where the breaker panel is in your new house and that you can find all the local GFCI outlets.

<p><h5>5. Smoke detectors and Fire alarms</h5>
 For your safety and convenience get smoke detectors that are connect directly to your electrical system.  It is common for batteries to fail and for people to ignore the waring noises they make.  Be sure to have enough smoke detectors, correctly place, and test them regularly.

<p><h5>6. Electrical Codes</h5>
Follow all local, state and national electrical codes.  Use a reputable company that has properly trained and licensed employees.  Your electrical system should be virtually trouble-free when professional designed and installed.
            </p>]]></description>

        <title>New adventures with Crestron</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>We are working on the largest Crestron project we ever head.  It is going to be 8 zones of HD video switching and 34 zones of distributed audio.  We are going to control it with a pair of 37" touchscreen tvs and 22 RTi remotes.  We are going to be doing some tricks to hide electronics without losing control.  </p>
<p>
Look forward to more information and hopefully some freebies and tutorials.

        <title>What I&#39;m working on</title>
        <description><![CDATA[I purchased a hardware development kit from <a href="synapse-wireless.com">synapse-wireless.com</a>.  They make a really unique zigbee platform that runs python byte code quasi-natively.  I am really amazed with it so far.  It is very nice when you come across a product that actually does what it says it will.    The wireless range really goes 75+ feet and it really does turn on in 100 ms.  It joins the network within another 100 ms.  By comparison it takes 300 ms for the human eye to blink.  That means it powers on and connects to the network faster than a blink.  I hope to post some examples soon.]]></description>

        <title>Elevator pitch</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<u>What do we do?</u>  We are trying to bring home automation to the masses.
<u>What makes us different?</u>  Instead of trying to launch a new product that users and dealers have to leave their current brands to adopt, we want to commodotize much of the design and programming for them.
<u>Who are you competing against?</u>  Our strategy is to make (or use existing) dealer agreements with all the major players (Crestron, AMX, Lutron, Vantage, Control4, RTI)
